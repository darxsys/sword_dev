Table automaton:

1) Creation of the table could be problematic. How to correctly allocate table size? Is that even possible?
Maybe reallocation to double the current size and then reallocation to the final size if
the allocated part ends up being bigger? Is this really amortized O(1)? Can we go faster?

Well, worst case is to allocate queryLen - seedLen + 1 states and then just reallocate in the end to the
real size? Maybe this is the best. This will waste a lot of memory during the process, maybe not even be
possible for huge strings. 

2) Functions:
Doing transitions.
Adding another table for hits for every state.
